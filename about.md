# Yopolazi is the loveliest memory of my hometown and my childhood 

Hi, my name is Jing. I was born in Xi’an, a famous ancient culinary city on the Silk Road. The word Yopolazi is the Chinese pronunciation for chili oil. It is the heart and soul of Xi’an food. I grew up with seeing it, smelling it and eating it everyday. 

Yopolazi is the my memory of grandma. She is the best chef I have ever seen. When I was a little boy, I always sneaked into her kitchen to get the first bite of her work and listen to her sharing her cooking secrets. I learned how to make Yopolazi there when I was ten. 

Today, I am so happy to take the loveliest memory of my hometown, childhood and grandma to this product and share it with everyone. I believe that the essence of traditional food can enlighten our modern life.
